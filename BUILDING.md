# Building Hardhat-Chainlink Plugin

1. Clone the repository
2. Use `yarn` to install all dependencies

> NOTE: Due to transitive dependency issue, `npm` cannot be used to build the project.

3. Build the plugin: `yarn run build`.
4. Use `yarn link` to test your changes against a consumer hardhat project (on your local machine).
